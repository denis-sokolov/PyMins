				<h1>
					<a name="developer">
						A web developer
					</a>
				</h1>
				<p>
					I make web applications.
					Be it websites or some tools or widgets.
					And I do it right.
					For I care about my honour first and money second.
					Thus, I prefer to spend more time,
						but make the final result better.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many developers out there,
						who think it&rsquo;s ok to do their job
						sloppily, as long as it looks ok from the
						outside.
					They say, that &lsquo;the internals don't really matter&rsquo;.
					But this is wrong and it backfires later.
					Thus, I pay a lot of attention to details and
						always reach for top quality.
					Luckily, I know a lot about the current stance
						on web technical trends and I always
						keep up to date.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently I am available for hire as a freelancer.
				</p>
				<h2>Specific skills</h2>
				<p>
					What I value the most is my overall understanding
						of web development.
					That includes good
					<abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> knowledge,
						understanding of <strong>usability</strong> and
						<strong>accessibility</strong>.
					Ability to stop and think about the design errors,
						find the mistakes or opportunities and offer
						improvements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, though, I have found myself learning
						<strong>typography</strong> and typography for
						the web.
					I hope to reach a serious level of comprehension
						in the nearest future.
				</p>
				<p>
					In coding, my main tool of choice is
					<abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Processor">PHP</abbr>.
					Wide spread, superb documentation and huge community
						are what makes it good.
					I am highly experienced in PHP.
				</p>

					></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, I am highly proficient with
						<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">
							HTML</abbr>
						and I keep up with the changes in the standart
						and its future.
					Where needed, I use
					<abbr title="eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>,
					although I think that it is overhyped and does not
						really have that many advantages.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the client-side, we code in <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
						Although I am not as experienced in it as I am
						in PHP,
						I still manage to get big things done, mostly
						because learned to use documentation
						effectively, to search for answers and find solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, there are <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>,
						micro formats,
						<abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>
						interactions.

			<li id="catBlock">
				<h1>
					<a name="cat">
						Kawaii Cat
					</a>
				</h1>
				<h2>
					What&rsquo;s <em>kawaii</em>?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Literally translated from Japanese,
						<em>kawaii</em> means <em>cute</em>.
					But there&rsquo;s much more to that.
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii"
						class="ext wp"
						title="Cuteness in Japanese culture on Wikipedia"
						><em>Cuteness</em> in Japanese culture</a>
						is more of a concept, a way of life.
					It's smiling, being nice and supportive.
					It's ignoring bad words and concentrating on
						positive aspects of every situation.
					It's... Kawaii. <span class="emoticon">^_~</span>
				</p>
				<h2>Life goals</h2>
				<p>
					I have got two main goals in my life: make people
						I love (myself included) happy and not disturb
						the happiness of other people.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a simple set of rules that leads me.
					They are:
				</p>
				<h3>Be kind and nice to everybody</h3>
				<p>
					For any new person, regardless of his or her
						identity, I try to be kind and friendly.
					In other words, I try to avoid prejudice.
					The only exception?
					Strange guys in dark streets.
				</p>
				<h3>Assume good faith</h3>
				<p>
					Always assume good faith in words or actions
						of other people.
					However unlikely it might look,
						I try to think that a person meant no
						offence&mdash;that
						either he made an honest mistake either
						I did not understand his or her real intentions.
					There's a reason why this is
						<a class="ext wp"
							title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith"
							href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith"
						>one of Wikipedia guidelines</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>Ignore baseless critics</h3>
				<p>
					&lsquo;Faggot!&rsquo;, &lsquo;Asshole!&rsquo;,
					&lsquo;This won't work!&rsquo;,
					&lsquo;You look silly!&rsquo;...
					Yeah, whatever.
				</p>
				<!--
					<h3>Value results over motives</h3>
					<p>
						Practice shows, that the output of an action is
							proportionate to the input to the action.
						&lsquo;I tried!&rsquo;, on the other hand,
							usually means &lsquo;I tried,
							but not really hard enough&rsquo;.
					</p>
				-->
				<h3>Have no principles</h3>
				<p>
					Being stubborn in any principle is very
						unflexible. I can do whatever is useful at the
						moment, if that will not hurt me, my future,
						or anyone else instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					This point highly correlates with my
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)"
							class="ext wp"
							title="Dungeons and Dragons concept of alignment explained on Wikipedia"
							><abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">DnD</abbr>
						alignment</a>,
						which is <a name="alignment">Lawful Neutral with
							a tendency for Good</a>.

							Forest&mdash;&lsquo;two cats and a dog&rsquo;"

					Denis is a cat. Monika is a cat. They both are
						wonderful cats. <span class="emoticon">=^o^=</span>

				<h1>
					<a name="fantasy">
						Fantasy world dweller
					</a>
				</h1>
				<p>
					I enjoy the fantasy world:
					I read about it,
					I play in it,
					I rule it.
				</p>
				<h2><abbr title="Role Playing Games">RPG</abbr>s</h2>
				<p>
					A while ago I tried and played both
						<abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">DnD</abbr>
						and
						<abbr title="Generic Universal Role Playing System"
							>GURPS</abbr>
						and I have to say, I like GURPS
						way more.
					It is versatile, more realistic and easier to
						adapt to one's will.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later, I game-(dungeon-)mastered some games of my own.
					I like it, but, unfortunately, it takes way too much
						time to fit in my today's schedule.
					I hope I'll get back to it one day...
				</p>
				<h2>
					Magic: the Gathering and DCI
				</h2>
				<p>
					I like a great collectible game
						&lsquo;<a href="http://wizards.com/magic/"
							class="ext"
							title="Magic: the Gathering homepage">Magic</a>&rsquo;.
					From
						<span class="note" title="A specific Magic set"
							>Mirrodin</span> to
						<span class="note" title="Another, later Magic set"
							>Ravnica</span> I have played it and
						step after step upgraded my mono-blue control deck.
					Today I no longer play it, but I judge it,

			<li id="socialBlock">
				<h1>
					<a name="social">
						Social attributes

				</h1>
				<h2>Religion</h2>
				<p>
					I am an
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignostic"
						class="ext wp"
							><strong>Ignostic</strong></a>, what in simple words means that I
						do not understand what the fuss is all about and
						will not understand it until someone gives me a
						clear definition of this &lsquo;God&rsquo;
						people are fighting for.
					What exactly do you mean by saying &lsquo;God&rsquo;?
					And while you think about it, think if
						<em>evolution</em> or <em>physics</em>
						fit your definition. Seriously.
				</p>
				<h2>Politics</h2>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, I am <strong>apolitic</strong>. That is, I do not know,
						I do not see, I do not have an opinion.
					Nevertheless, I vote. I ask my friends, what is the
						correct way and I vote, effectively multyplying
						the opinion of my friends, whom I trust.
				</p>
				<h2>Fashion</h2>
				<p>
					Could not care less.
				</p>
				<h2>Music</h2>
				<p>
					I've got quite an <strong>eclectic</strong> music taste.
					For instance, my favourite artists are CocoRosie, Jean
					Michel Jarre and Yuki Kajiura.
					All three are very different, I would say, incompatible.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first and foremost stands
					<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/CocoRosie"
						class="ext lastfm">CocoRosie</a>â€”a pair
						of two sweet <strong>freak folk</strong> girls,
						who have very touching voice and sound.
						There are similarities with BjÃ¶rk or Joanna
						Newsom (I like both), but CocoRosie feels more...
						intimate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, the master of <strong>electronic</strong>
						music, the God and creator himself,
						<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jean-Michel+Jarre"
							class="ext lastfm">Jean Michel Jarre</a>.
					I do not usually listen to electronic music that
						much, but he is an exception to the rule, for his
						creations fit unbelievably with my hobby of
						coding. Whatever the time of the day, there is
						no better sounds to lead me to action, than
						Oxygene or Rendezâ€“Vous albums.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, I like music, based on
						<strong>anime soundtracks</strong>.
						I am talking of course, about
						<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/%E6%A2%B6%E6%B5%A6%E7%94%B1%E8%A8%98"
							class="ext lastfm">Yuki Kajiura</a>, who
						is a wonderful creator and a magical lady,
						which fills my soul with extraordinar music.
					Other great artists are The Pillows, Jinn, soundTemp.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, I love <strong>jazz</strong>. Mostly
						swing and bebop, but a few calmer melodies as
						well. These are the main artists:
					Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Melody Gardot,
						Petra Magoni, Dave Brubeck Quartet.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					Further, <strong>rock</strong> is good as well and I enjoy listening to
						Scorpions as much as I do listening to the Offspring.
					However, I will avoid aggressive kinds.
